/**
 * This an implementation of a lock-free ordered linked list data structure. The
 * implementation is according to the paper <a
 * href="http://www.research.ibm.com/people/m/michael/spaa-2002.pdf"> High
 * Performance Dynamic Lock-Free Hash Tables and List-Based Sets</a> by Maged
 * M. Michael, 2002. To gain a complete understanding of this data structure,
 * please first read this paper, available at:
 * http://www.research.ibm.com/people/m/michael/spaa-2002.pdf
 * <p>
 * An unbounded thread-safe linked list which its element is ordered.
 * 
 * A <tt>LockFreeOrderedList</tt> is an appropriate choice when many threads
 * will share access to a common collection. This list does not permit
 * <tt>null</tt> elements. All elements in the list is ordered according to
 * compare()
 * <p>
 * This is a lock-free implementation intended for highly scalable add, remove
 * and contains which is thread safe. All mothed related to index is not thread
 * safe. Add() will add the element to the head of the list which is different
 * with the normal list.
